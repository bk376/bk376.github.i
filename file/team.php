                    <p>This is your main hub for all of the information you need to develop competition entry. Here you can start the process of creating your team by completing the Intel Open Registration, read about what you can build, and what makes a project "the best". </p>
                        
                    
                    <h3>What Can I Build</h3>
                    <p>Nearly anything you can imagine that incorporates an innovative use of embedded systems. Ideas include:</p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Intelligent Home Appliances</li>
                        <li>Radar Imaging Systems</li>
                        <li>In-Store Sale and Inventory Systems</li>
                        <li>Efficient Digital Storage Systems</li>
                        <li>Health Monitoring System</li>
                        <li>Environmental Waste Scrubbers</li>
                        <li>Robotics</li>
                        <li>Security Systems</li>
                        <li>Educational Electronics Toolkit</li>
                        <li>Building Energy System</li>
                        <li>Manufacturing Inspection</li>
                        <li>Ice Cream Taster</li>
                        <li>Intelligent Transportation Systems</li>
                        
                        </ul>
                    <p>It's not necessarily the project that is the best idea that will win but it is the project that is "done the best" that will win the grand prize. </p>
                        
                    <h3>What Is A Project That Is "Done The Best?"</h3>
                    <p>The best projects are the ones that can identify and realize a solution that most effectively and efficiently meets a specific challenge's needs. This application process was designed to help you demonstrate that: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You understand your challenge and its needs well.</li>
                        <li>You have well defined solution concept that can meet those needs.</li>
                        <li>You have ways for demonstrating and measuring how well your solution meets those needs.</li>
                        <li>You have a well thought out plan for making your solution a reality.</li>
                        <li>You have taken the time to think about your solution's implementation to ensure that the underlying principles are achievable and realistic given the resources you have available.</li>
                        <li>You have considered potential problems that could occur from both the design concept and during the development such that in the end you will still be able to deliver as complete and robust a product as possible to within the scope of your proposed solution.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The greatest projects are not those that always achieve the "flashiest" results, the greatest projects are those that make the best use of their time and resources to meet a specific need. </p>

                    <p>Be sure to check out the judging criteria and if you have any questions on the criteria or the design guides, be sure to attend one of the on-line info sessions. There's one almost every week!</p>
